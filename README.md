# Static Taxi Service
---
### I recently came across an exciting project on Upwork Platform and decided to dive in to sharpen my React JS skills

## The task
I need a React JS developer to create a simple, static website to display my car taxi services. The
website should include:

- A list of all my cars, including details like car model and availability.
- My operating hours and ride price per mile.
- A section for the list of drivers.
- No backend required, just a static React JS application to display information.
- The site should be responsive and well-designed.

Project Requirements:

- The website should be designed and developed in React JS.
- Hosting the website on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar (easy-to-deploy options).
- Easy to update or modify as needed.

Deliverables:

- Source code in a GitHub repository.
- The site hosted and live with all the necessary content.
